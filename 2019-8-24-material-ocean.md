Nowdays I am using Material Ocean theme like literally everywhere for every apps I am using it as theme and I have became a huge fan of material ocean theme
Here aere some pictures and info about it.

###### Homescreen:

So lets start with the materialized homescreen

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/newhome.png">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/newqs.png">
    </div>
</div>
 
this is the homescreen and as you can see how much lit it is matching with the material ocean.

###### Apps:

Oh yeah material ocean looks classic 

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/spotify.png">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/cold.png">
    </div>
</div>
 
Materialized Spotify xD .. btw I have been listening to neffex from months and really they are good nibbas .. My favoriate is Cold by the way as you can see still I am listening to that song ðŸ˜ƒ

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/tg.png">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/netflix.png">

</div>

These are the apps which I mostly use... If your eyes are at netflix, xD  I dont use it more, just started watching some animes xD .
