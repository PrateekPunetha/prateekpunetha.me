Its been like 3-4 months I was using nitrogen os pie as my daily driver ROM and also maintaining it for my device xD, and suddenly when the Android 10 released I got excited for trying it to be honest. So I was searching at github for taking refrence from other device trees so that I could compile Nos 10 for my device, and actually I found many important things and I finally compiled nos for my device, btw you can check my github for all the sources.
I would like to thank Max (xyyx), wight554 (Volodymyr Zhdanov), AmulyaX (Amulya Bhardwaj) and  blacksuan19 (Abubakar Yagoub) for helping me since the starting of the project from the pie times ( all are my good fams btw ).
