Today two months are completed since I am using nos and also maintaining it for my device  xD and during these months I got to learn so many things related to linux, git, etc. <br>
I would like to thanks AmulyaX, blacksuan19, Max ( Nos creator xD btw he helps me many times ) and Rahul ( All are my fams ) for helping me regarding this project. <br>

###### Customizations:

Nitrogen OS have many customization options btw, Here are some main things :

> Status Bar Customization <br>
> Navigation Bar Customization <br>
> Lockscreen Customization <br>
> Power Menu Customization <br>

These are some screenshots of nos, the theme is material ocean by the way which is nowdays my personal favourite, It was suggested to me by ma nibba  blacksuan19 , and the icon pack is Alexis which is also my personal favourite.

###### Battery life:

I have tried like many roms for my device i.e Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus (Vince), But I got the most amazing and  lit  Screen On time in Nitrogen OS.

    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">

As you can see the solid af battery stats which I got from nos, the Kernel which I am using is Dark Ages, this is also by blacksuan19 ( he peru xD ) , I always build nos with this kernel. <br>
